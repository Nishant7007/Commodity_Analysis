# Price Forecasting and Anomaly Detection for Agricultural commodities in India

The project aims at building an end to end system (dashboard) for following tasks:

1. Time series forecasting: Forecasting of arrival and mandi data for various commodities using regression based and deep learning methods
2. Anomaly Detection: Detecting various anomalies using machine learning and statistical properties of time series 
3. News feed: Finding relevant news articles for various anomalies and showing the newsfeed, original and forecasted series, different trends and anomalies detected.
